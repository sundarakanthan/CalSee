Calsee is a simple calculator app built using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript.
The working is quite simple like other calculators.
Used bootstrap grid layout to make it responsive in all devices.
To test it:
  open the https://sundarakanthan.github.io/CalSee/ 
  Then go to responsive mode -> set Dimensions:Responsive , shrink and test the responsiveness.

Future Upgrades:
  Adding the clear functionality (removing numbers one by one)
  Adding Animations and changing UI
