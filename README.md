<h2>CalSee</h2>
Calsee is a simple calculator app built using <strong>HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap</strong> and <strong>Javascript.</strong>
The working is quite simple like other calculators. 
The main objective of this app is to showcase responsive layout.
Used bootstrap's grid layout to make it responsive in all devices.
This project is live at https://sundarakanthan.github.io/CalSee/ 
To test it:
  open the https://sundarakanthan.github.io/CalSee/ 
  Then go to responsive mode -> set Dimensions:Responsive , shrink and test the responsiveness.

Future Upgrades:
